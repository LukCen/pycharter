# PyCharter - charting made simple(ish)

PyChart is a very simple GUI tool for generating line charts, written using Python.

It consists of a few parts:

- an input element for the X axis
- an input element for the Y axis
- a display area, showing you key/value pairs consisting of data already added
- a chart made with matplotlib, for the data you input

To use it, run 'main.py' in the terminal. A non-terminal version will be made in the future.
